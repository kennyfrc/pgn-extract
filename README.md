## Change History

*   22nd Apr 2019: Improved --repetition so that it does not give false positives when castling rights or who is to move are different.

    Retain next move number rather than resetting to 1 with --dropply and --dropbefore.

*   14th Apr 2019: Fixed a memory error in v18-10 that occurred when a positional match was found but the moves of the game were invalid.
*   28th Mar 2019: Added --xroster to suppress tags that are not required with -R.
*   13th Nov 2018: Missing SetUp tags no longer elicit an error message as this contravention of the standard is so common.
*   28th Oct 2018: Negative value accepted with --dropply to indicates plies to be retained at the end of the game.
*   18th Oct 2018: open game files in binary mode to cope with the Ctrl characters that appear in some.
*   17th Oct 2018: Accept Z0 as an alternative to --.
*   13th Oct 2018: Added --dropbefore as a result of a suggestion by Josip Salai. Fixed missing SetUp tag with --dropply. Fixed -H to work with 32-bit Windows.
*   7th Oct 2018: Added -y.
*   19th Aug 2018: Fixed a memory leak with -z.
*   11th July 2018: Added the MatchLabel tag and FENPatternI matching with -t after a suggestion by Hedinn Steingrimsson. In addition, significantly improved the efficiency of FENPattern matches.
*   3rd July 2018: Added the MaterialMatch tag with -z after a suggestion by Hedinn Steingrimsson.
*   23rd Apr 2018: With -R, include tags in the output that are not explicitly listed in the roster order. This aligns the behaviour with the documentation.
*   9th Feb 2018: Suppress warning for null moves when --allownullmoves is used. With --fixresulttags, prefer the terminating result if either it or the result tag is "*".
*   29th Dec 2017: Corrected failure to OR rather than AND the pseudo Elo tag used with -t.
*   17th Dec 2017: Accepted multiple NAG comment pairs after a move. If NAGs are suppressed then the associated comments are retained.
*   30th Nov 2017: Added --nestedcomments.
*   12th Nov 2017: Added --dropply after a suggestion by Heiko Bruns.
*   5th Oct 2017: Only require "960" in Variant tag strings for Chess960 games.
*   23rd Sep 2017: Added the previously documented, but unimplemented --underpromotion.
*   3rd Sep 2017: Bug fix for zero-move games which were not being followed by a blank line.
*   26th July 2017: --matchplylimit added following a suggestion by James Ward.
*   23rd July 2017: Bug fix for --splitvariants.
*   21st July 2017: Added --nobadresults to suppress games with inconsistent result indications. Fixed failure to correct terminating result with --fixresulttags. Added --allownullmoves.
*   15th July 2017: Added -Tf for FEN pattern matching.
*   8th July 2017: Added --plycount. With -z, use a FEN tag (if present) to count the number of pieces.
*   6th July 2017: Adjusted -z to work correctly with a position stability value of 0. Implemented the suggestion of Josip Salai that that FEN as the marker with --markmatches should be interpreted as a request to output the FEN encoding of the match position.
*   28th June 2017: Added a c1 comment to -Wepd output to record the game's result. Added the requirement that the Variant tag contain the string "chess 960" to be considered as Chess960 games on output. This primarily affects encoding of castling moves in long-algebraic notation.
*   6th June 2017: Added a second number to the -# flag to control file numbering.
*   4th June 2017: Chess960 long algebraic castling notation accommodated on both input and output. This is where castling is indicated by specifying the Rook's column as the destination for the King.

*   29th January 2017: Added --hashcomments to add a comment containing a polyglot hash code after each move. Added -H for Zobrist polyglot hash matches.
*   Added text after -F for FEN-position output at arbitrary positions and not simply at the end of a game. Suggested by Josip Salai.
*   22nd January 2017: Added --stopafter.
*   20th January 2017: Added --nosetuptags and --onlysetuptags following a discussion with Mike Crockett. Added -p[elu] for finer control of game length matching than provided by -b.

*   23rd Mar 2015: Added --nofauxep after a suggestion by Norm Pollock.
*   21st Mar 2015: Fixed off-by-one in move number output with -F when white-to-move.
*   20th Mar 2015: Added -Wxlalg at the suggestion of Bruce Ramsey.
*   8th Jan 2015: Fixed bug in game counting with -#. Suppressed games with null moves (--) in the main line.
*   28th October 2014\. Added --selectonly after a suggestion by Francis Steen.
*   2nd September 2014\. Corrected an error in the generation of hashcodes when a promotion is made.

    Games with zero moves are now acceptable.
*   26th April 2004: Slight modification to one of the hashing values made in order to try to avoid clashes in ECO matches. ECO matches now have a discretion of up to 6 half moves.

*   27th March 2001
    *   Added output of EPD via -Wepd.
    *   Fixed a long standing error in FEN castling rights. These were not being withdrawn if a Rook was captured on its home square. Pointed out by Karl-Martin Skontorp, who also provided the incentive to add -Wepd.

    *   Extended usage of -Wsan to support output in different languages.
    *   Usage of -e with -7 retains an ECO tag in matched games.
    *   FEN tags with the -t flag are used as positional matches (equivalent to -x matches).
    *   Non-standard tags are now retained in game output.
*   12th January 2000 C compiler with Red Hat Linux 6 was no longer happy with static initialisations involving stdin, stdout and stderr. Changes made to lex.c and main.c to work around this. Pointed out by Mladen Bestvina.
*   18th October 1999 Numbers greater than 3 allowed with -E, at the request of Owen Lyne.
*   15th December 1997 Treat \r as WHITESPACE (for DOS files).
*   8th June 1997 Added -b flag to set bounds on the number of moves in a game to be matched.

*   17th February 1997 Added a little more error recovery.
*   15th November 1996 Added -Z.
*   23rd Sep 1996 It is no longer necessary to omit move numbers from the variations files (-v and -x). This makes it easier to cut and paste games of interest into these files.
*   28th Jun 1996 It is no longer necessary to terminate the tag file (-t). Relational operators added in the tag file (-t). Added -E flag.
*   7th May 1996 Corrected failure to make ECO classification when combined with -x. Added lalg and halg as long algebraic output formats.

*   14th Jul 1995: Made the order of arguments immaterial.
*   5th Jul 1995:
    *   Added ECO classification with -e.
    *   Fixed false partial substring matches with -v, e.g. textual variation move Nc6 is now no longer matched by game move c6.
*   22nd Mar 1995: Made permutation matching with -v the default and added -P to suppress it.
*   Jan 1995: Added -n and -L.
*   17th Nov 1994: Liberated the program from using YACC and Lex.
*   13th Oct 1994: Released test version with ChessMaster output.

*   8th Jul 1994:
    *   Added -o flag.
    *   Discarded writing to standard output in DOS version because of extensive problems trying to make this work with redirected output. Instead, output is written to the file extract.pgn.
